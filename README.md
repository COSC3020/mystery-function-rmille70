# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

Answer: It returns the greatest item recursively by going all the way down
to the base case (when a.length is equal to 1), and then as it returns, it 
compompares to the largest item in those sublists until we have the largest 
item in the list.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```
